/**
 * Adding this annotation to a field or method is meant to specify that
 * that is the field/method which signals whether the data has been validated.
 * 
 * Right now, this only makes sense on a method/field which returns a boolean.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * TODO: When more data, beyond whether the record is / is not validated is desired,
 * what should be done? Should any class wishing to have this information accessible
 * return a specified "ValidationState" object? Or should the annotations be expanded,
 * and several fields used?
