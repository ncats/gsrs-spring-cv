/**
 * Types annotated with "@SingleParent" are considered
 * to "belong to" some other entity, such that they should
 * be deleted when the parent is deleted.
 * 
 * This can be used as a signal to perform certain database actions.
 * Specifically, it can be used to simulate the effects of
 * JPA 2.0 "orphanRemoval", where being removed from a parent 
 * list will always trigger a deletion of the element.
 *

 * 
 * Unlike orphanRemoval, however, it is not necessary to know
 * the exact parent collection field that possesses this object.
